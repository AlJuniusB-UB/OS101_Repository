For all the girls out there.
DONT DO HINTS! men are oblivious simple creatures, we do not pick them up. If you want to get a boyfriend JUST ASK. If you try to be subtle it WILL fly over our heads. This is a fool proof way of getting a boyfriend:

Get to know a boy. Either talk to him or buy him food. Just become friends.

Get to know him and let him get to know you. Become closer friends and just hang out more.

ASK. tell him do you wanna be my boyfriend? And reassure him that ur not joking.

Works 8/10 times. He will be the happiest man on earth and you will have a boyfriend, easy. I know some of you needed to hear this.
